// Your task is to finish a custom Input component that was created by a colleague.

// The Input component must be highly configurable and meet the following requirements:

// It must accept a label prop which is used to set the text for the <label> element (i.e., between the <label> tags)

// It must accept all other attributes that could be added to <input> elements and set those props on the <input> element

// It must accept the special ref prop and connect the received ref to the <input> element

// This Input component can then be used in the App component. There, it's actually already being used and some props
// (the label and type props) are already set on the custom Input component.

// But in addition, your task also is to read the entered name and email values inside of the handleSaveData
// function with help of React's "ref" feature.

// To achieve this task, you must ensure that the custom Input component is able to receive the special ref
// prop and that this prop is then "connected" to the returned <input> element.

// Of course you also must add fitting refs to the App component and use them in handleSaveData to retrieve the actual entered input data.

// The read values must then be stored in the already-existing userData object.

import { useRef } from "react";
import Input from "./components/Input";

export const userData = {
  name: '',
  email: '',
};

export function App() {
  const name = useRef();
  const email = useRef();

  function handleSaveData() {
    const enteredName = name.current.value;
    const enteredEmail = email.current.value;

    userData.name = enteredName;
    userData.email = enteredEmail;

    console.log(userData);
  }

  return (
    <div id="app">
      <Input type="text" label="Your Name" ref={name} />
      <Input type="email" label="Your E-Mail" ref={email} />
      <p id="actions">
        <button onClick={handleSaveData}>Save Data</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
